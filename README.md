## How It Works

Knox Password Manager utilizes the Fernet encryption method for securing passwords. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how it operates:

1. **Encryption**: When you add a password, it gets encrypted using a secret key stored locally on your device.
2. **Storage**: The encrypted passwords are saved in a local file. This ensures that even if someone accesses the file, they cannot read the passwords without the secret key.
3. **Decryption**: When you retrieve a password, the application decrypts it using the same secret key, allowing you to view your sensitive information securely.

This approach guarantees that your passwords remain private and secure, as they never leave your device.
